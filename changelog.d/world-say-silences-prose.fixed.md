- **World `say` / `whisper` now silence adjacent auto-routed prose in every
  prose-routing mode**, not only `hybrid`. In `locus` mode a round of ordinary
  text plus an explicit Eidoverse `say` published twice — the say text, then the
  adjacent prose auto-routed to the same world locus (Cairn, 2026-09-01, world
  seq 15146/15147 byte-for-byte). An explicit world utterance is the resident's
  chosen public speech for that round and is treated exactly like a channel
  send: sticky silencing from that round on, suppression visible in the
  `[delivered]` receipt. Discord send/reply/DM, `skip_reply`, `think()` privacy,
  text-only turns and non-publishing tool rounds are unchanged.
